# Hand Cricket Match Runs
# Given two columns of numbers from 0 to 6, separated by space, played by batsman and bowler in a hand cricket match, find the total number of balls played and the total runs scored by the batsman at the end of the innings.

# The match ends when the batsman plays the same number as the bowler or plays the same number twice continously.

# The number batsman plays will be added to the runs, except when batsman plays 0, the number bowler plays will be added to the runs.

# The number played when the game ends is not counted towards the runs.

# Input Format

# Each line with numbers played by batsman and bowler separated by space.
# Output Format

# Number of balls played and the total runs separated by space.
# Example

# Input:

# 1 4
# 2 3
# 6 2
# 5 1
# 0 2
# 3 3
# Output:

# 6 16
# Explanation

# 1 4 - 1
# 2 3 - 2
# 6 2 - 6
# 5 1 - 5
# 0 2 - 2 (0 played by batsman so 2 is counted as runs)
# 3 3 - out
# Total: 1+2+2+5+2 = 16
# Input:

# 1 4
# 5 3
# 0 3
# 5 1
# 5 4
# Output:

# 5 14
# Explanation

# 1 4 - 1
# 5 3 - 5
# 0 3 - 3 (0 played by batsman so 2 is counted as runs)
# 5 1 - 5
# 5 4 - out (batsman played 5 twice continously)
# Total: 1+5+3+5 = 14
